* Homework 1 for semantic HTML (02/13/2021)

## The HTML needed to be more semantic
* I changed div tags to section tags and made and aside tag to make the flow easier to read.
* I also added header and footer tags.

## The CSS Stylings needed to be condensed and renamed
* I changed Search engine optimization classes to seo classes
* I changed all of the div classes in my main tag to business function classes
* I changed the div classes in my aside tag to say Benefits
